This repository archives weekly meetings at [tinygrad discord](https://discord.gg/ZjZadyC7PK).
Meetings are currently Mondays 9:30 AM PST in the #reds-only-vc voice channel. Feel free to join, listen, and ask questions in either #general chat or #reds-only-vc chat.
Meetings are subject to change depending on where in the world Geohot is currently residing.

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve the transcription or whatever nifty cool AI things to add to the archive, please post a [new issue](https://github.com/geohotstan/tinycorp-meetings/issues/new)
I'll try my best to make it work :D
