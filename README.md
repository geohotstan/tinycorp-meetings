This repository serves as an archive for weekly meetings held on the [Tinygrad Discord](https://discord.gg/ZjZadyC7PK).  

Meetings are currently Mondays 9:30 AM PST in the `#reds-only-vc` voice channel.  
Feel free to join, listen, and ask questions in either `#general` or `#reds-only-vc` chat.  
Please stay on topic when asking questions though (don't be asking about crypto for example ðŸ˜…). 

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve the transcription or if you know some hip new AI tool I can use to better the archive, please post a [new issue](https://github.com/geohotstan/tinycorp-meetings/issues/new)  
I'll try my best to make it work! ðŸ¤—
